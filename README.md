This project aims to create a unified analytics platform to understand trends and patterns in online content consumption and search behavior. By ingesting and integrating Google Trends data, U.S. Census demographic data, and YouTube API data, we can uncover key trends, correlations, and emerging topics. The platform will provide marketers, content creators, and researchers with actionable insights through interactive dashboards and a flexible API. The core objective is to move from isolated datasets to a centralized, reliable source of truth for understanding digital interest across different demographics and geographies.
